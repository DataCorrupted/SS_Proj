\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{graphicx}
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%Porrf of FXLMS
\section{Proof of FXLMS}

	It is clear in Gan and others paper\cite{Gan2005Adaptive,Song2005Robust} how FXLMS should be implemented and used in ANC, but they didn't provide a clear proof of why should $\omega_l$ be updated in the following way:
	$$\omega(n+1) = \omega(n) + \frac{\mu}{\widehat P_x(n)+c}e^Tx$$
	Here we will give a simple proof, or an explanation for this update.
	Now that we recorded certain samples of errors, we can calculate it's cost function value:
	$$ C =\frac{1}{2} e^Te $$
	Here, let's assume that e is a vector with history records. \\
	However, notice that:
	$$ e(n) = d(n) - \omega_l(n)^T x$$
	So to minimize C, we need to take derivatives of $\omega_l$, which gives:
	$$ \nabla_{\omega_l} C = \frac{1}{2}2e^T\nabla{\omega_l} e = e^T(-x) = -e^Tx $$
	Now we know that the gradient, all we need to do is update $\omega$:
	$$ \omega(n+1) = \omega(n) - \nabla_{\omega_l} C = \omega(n) + e^Tx $$
	
\par 
	This result is close to that shown above, but unfortunately not enough.
	From experiment we noticed that $\omega$ doesn't converge, it goes to infinity as time goes by.\\
	After trials and errors we decided that LMS is not enough for this task since $\omega$ is not converging.
	This may happen when the variance is large\cite{Dhiman2013Comparison}, 
	which would be the common case for white noise. 
\par 
	The solution is to change learning rate($\mu$) according to $x$ we get. We took Dhiman's advice and changed the update function to:
	$$\omega(n+1) = \omega(n) + \frac{\mu}{x^Tx}e^Tx$$
\par 
	The result is, that $\mu$ goes to infinity even faster. After a few toughs we realized that at the very beginning, $x$ can be really sparse and close to zero.
	As a result, $x^Tx$ can be really small(smaller than 1), thus leads to a greater $\mu$, which is not desirable.
	The solution to that, is to add a constant after $x^Tx$, then we have:
	$$\omega(n+1) = \omega(n) + \frac{\mu}{x^Tx+C}e^Tx$$
	The constant we choose is $C==1$
\par 
	Another thing to consider is, should all history records be considered equal 
	when they act as a Still, this is not the same as learning step controller.
	Actually, not. We need the closes history record to be more important than others.
	So we do a scale according to history. 
	That's how the the formula defined above came around. 
	If we take a look back how $\widehat P_x(n)$ is defined:
	$$ \widehat P_x(n) = \alpha x(n)^2 + (1-\alpha)\widehat P_x(n-1)$$
	$$ \alpha \approx 1$$
	Then it's clear that in $ \widehat P_x(n) $ the closest history is the most important.
\par
	Now we have explained step by step, from LMS to NLMS to FXLMS, that the update formula of $\omega_l$ is
	reasonable and valid. Next we will implement them in two approaches: Simulink approach and MATLAB approach.

%Implementation details
\section{Implementation}
Implementation details goes here.

\subsection{Simulink approach}
The Simulink approach is shown in Figure 1.Note that this is an offline simulation, so we use noise generator instead of one microphone. mixture of noise and music instead of another microphone.
\par
We use a random generator to simulate the white noise. Then there will be a LPF to filter the high frequency noise. The Digital Filter1 and Lowpass1 in the Figure 1 do this thing.
\par
And for the LMS Fliter part , there are two input , one is the noise, another is the the mixture of noise and music. As proofed above, the LMS Fliter can then get the Error, easy to see the Error should be close to the music.
\par
The Audio Device is the Error, which should be music without noise. And in the scope we can see the waveform of noise , music , mixture , and Error.
\par
But there are still some bugs, for example , the simulink do not support high frequency , and there will be more noise when the input "music" is speech rather than music.
\begin{figure} 
	\begin{center}     
     \includegraphics[width=10cm]{ANC_try1.pdf}
	\caption{Simulink ANC} \label{fig1}
	\end{center}
	\begin{center}     
     \includegraphics[width=10cm]{scope.pdf}
	\caption{ANC Scope} \label{fig2}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{MATLAB approach}
The MATLAB approach support two channel audio. The implementation is similar to Simulink approach.
\par
For simulation, we use a two channel audio file and a pre-generated two channel noise file to simulate the real-time environment. The MATLAB code use dsp.AudioFileReader to read in signal and noise files. Here, we simulate one microphone to get the mixture of signal and noise from the environment. 
\par
In the system, first we subtract the noise from the mixture as noise = mixture - signal. Then the LMS algorithm uses noise and music to get the output like what has been mentioned above. In the code, the dsp.LMSfilter is used to perform the algorithm. Also, the low-pass filter used in simulink approach is also used here.
As for the two-channel part, the input is separated into two ANC systems, and the output is consist of outputs from both ANC systems.

% I/O latency
\section{I/O latency}
For a real-time system, I/O latency has a huge impact on the performance of the system.
\par
MATLAB audio latency test program audioLatencyMeasurementExampleApp.m is used to test the audio latency. The test is run on window 10 with Intel i7-5500U processor, 2.4ghz, and results are shown in the table. 
\par

% latency test result
\begin{table}[latency]
\centering
\caption{Audio I/O latency}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Test NO. & Latency(s) \\
1        & 0.2361     \\
2        & 0.2364     \\
3        & 0.2323     \\
4        & 0.2380     \\
5        & 0.2366    
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The test read in an audio file, play it with soundbar and record back using a microphone. Then it calculate the latency by calculate the delay between the original signal and the recorded signal.
\par
As is shown in the table, the average latency on PC is 0.2358 seconds. As has mentioned above, the LMS filter has an assumption that the training data and predicted data is in one period thus can be regarded as a line. However, with such an audio I/O latency, the predicted data will be several periods away from the training data. Thus, the LMS filter can not be applied on PC with such a latency.

This is a Signal & System project.
We worked on Adaptive Noise Canceler

Reference/, inside there are papers about that topic.
Report/ is all Latex files explaining what we did, refer to Report.pdf, inside 
Pre/ contain Files used for presentation are in 
Source/ contain test musics, these test files are in 2 wavs are our tests. One(Liberation.wav) is signal, another is white noise.

ANC_*.slx are finished ones.
Record.m is a demo showing that the latency is huge.
ANC_main.m is a MATLAB implementation of ANC.

Finally, to have a better sense of what we did, check Report.pdf, generated by Latex.

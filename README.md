This is a Signal & System project.
We worked on Adaptive Noise Canceler, for more details, refer to Reference, inside there are papers about that topic.
2 wavs are our tests. One(Liberation.wav) is signal, another is white noise.
ANC_try1.slx is a finished one. Panganq Finished it.
Still we try to do it by code instead of simulink, thats LMS.m and ANC_main.m
